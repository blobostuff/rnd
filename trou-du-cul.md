## Boilerplate

The game of "Trou du cul" ("Ass Hole" in french), seems to be derived from the
Japanese card game
["Daifugo" or "Daihinmin"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daifug%C5%8D), and this
must be true as changing the language from French to English on the French
[Trou du cul wikipedia article](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trou_du_cul_(jeu))
lands you [there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daifug%C5%8D).

The rule set described in this document is one that, for some reason, happens to
make a few people angry. The deliverance of said rule set to new players by the
author of this document rather than the rule set itself is believed to be a
plausible explanation for aforementioned anger.

Please be warned that you are now reading a document produced by the author of
that document and may be at risk of experiencing anger. Most likely
though, the benefits would outweigh the costs.

## Actual rules

### Preliminaries

Our "Trou du cul" can be played by 2 to 5 players, with a standard deck of 52
cards (no Jokers). A card's suit does not matter, and cards otherwise follow
the *usual order* with the exception that `2`s are highest, that is the
**trou du cul card order**
`3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < A < 2`.

For games with uneven numbers of players, the table can hold cards. Please note
that for games of "Trou du cul" played on a surface other than a table (e.g. a
bed, a couch, a carpet, the floor...), future references to "the table" across
this document shall be understood as "that surface you're playing on". Possible
interactions with "the table" will be described in a following section.

#### Definitions

Certain terms that may require clarification are defined here. It is a good
idea to familiarize oneself with what those terms are before reading the rest
of this document, and come back for the actual definitions on a need to know
basis as reading through the document.

A game is composed of many rounds.
A round is composed of many turns.

- **in game**: A player is **in game** if they have cards remaining in their
    hand.
- **in round**: A player is **in round** if they are **in game** and have not
    chosen to **fold** in the current round yet.
- **player order**: the **player order** is some given
    [cyclic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order) on the players.
    It defines who "the next" player is (e.g. the human to your left).
- **kind of hand**: a kind of hand is one of
  * a "single card" (i.e. just the one card)
  * a "pair" (i.e. 2 cards of same rank in the **trou du cul card order**)
  * a "three of a kind" (i.e. 3 cards of same rank in the
      **trou du cul card order**)
  * a "four of a kind" (i.e. 4 cards of same rank in the
      **trou du cul card order**)
- **trou du cul card order**: the card order used in "Trou du cul", Basically
    the *usual order* with the exception that `2`s are highest, that is
  * for "single card" **kind of hand**:
    `3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < A < 2`
  * for "pair" **kind of hand**:
    `{3, 3} < {4, 4} < [...] < {K, K} < {A, A} < {2, 2}`
  * for "three of a kind" **kind of hand**:
    `{3, 3, 3} < {4, 4, 4} < [...] < {K, K, K} < {A, A, A} < {2, 2, 2}`
  No order need defining for "four of a kind" **kind of hand** *(this is explained in a later section)*.
- **be skipped**: when a player chooses to **be skipped**, they do not
    play cards on this turn and remain **in round**.
- **fold**: when a player chooses to **fold**, they do not play cards on this
    turn and are no longer **in round**.

### Setup

Shuffle the deck. Distribute the 52 cards evenly amongst the players. Specifically, for the following numbers of players:

1. ~Shit out of luck, you're alone, you get 52 cards, and you lose... Also, if you are reading this, you've just lost [the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game)).~
2. Each player receives 26 cards.
3. Each player receives 17 cards. The table receives 1 card.
4. Each player receives 13 cards.
5. Each player receives 10 cards. The table receives 2 cards.

More players make for a boring game, and those rules do not cover for such
cases at this time (and most likely not at a later time either).

### Gameplay

#### Overview

To win at "Trou du cul", a player wants to get rid of their cards before the
other(s). Playing cards during the different rounds will enable players to
empty their hand on their turn, but possibly harm their ability to play in
following rounds. Once a player has no more card in their hand, they are out of
the game.  Remaining players continue to play until only one stays to establish
an order which is used to allocate cards for the next game. The overall game of
"Trou du cul" shall end when enough players get bored of it.

#### Detailed rules

A game of "Trou du cul" is divided in many rounds. On each round, players
follow the **players order** to play their turns.

##### Rounds

The first round is started by a player chosen by some mean out of the scope of
these rules. Following rounds are opened by the winner of the previous round if
that player is still in game, otherwise, by the next player still in game.

At the beginning of a round, all **in game** players become **in round** (those
who are no longer **in game** no longer play because they already won)(*duh*). As
the players play their turns, they may chose or have to **fold**. When a player
**folds**, they are no longer **in round**. A round is won by the last player
**in round**.

##### Turns

*The general unfolding of turns is described in the following paragraphs. As you
read the first paragraphs, keep in mind that special cases are described in later
paragraphs.*

---

*For games with uneven numbers of player*, at the beginning of one's turn, one
may chose to exchange one of the cards on *the table* for a card of their hand
with a strictly higher rank in **trou du cul card order**.
> Note that this rule can be deliberately paralysed by exchanging a `2` from
> one's hand.

---

On the opening turn of a round, the opening player must play one or several
cards in a valid **kind of hand**.
The opening turn of a round fully determines the valid **kind of hand** that
can be played on that round: when one of {*a single card*, *a pair*, *a three
of a kind*, *a four of a kind*} is played on the opening turn, only that **kind
of hand** can be played during for the rest of the round.
Once the opening turn of a round is played, the round proceeds with the turn of
the next player in the **player order**.
> Note that it is possible for no players to be able to do anything but
> **fold** after an opening turn. This is a valid play, and simply leads to the
> start of a new round with the winner of the previous round remaining the
> winner as per naturally following the rules exposed so far.

---

On following turns, one may perform one of the following actions:
- **Fold**.
- Play equal or higher in the current valid **kind of hand**.
> Note that, as stated, this rule allows for one to chose to **fold** when they
> could have played.

---

*These basic rules are altered in the following special cases:*

---

At the beginning of one's turn, if the last play was equal to the one previous,
the current player can choose between the following actions (in place of the
standard ones):
- **Be skipped**.
- Play equal in the current valid **kind of hand**.
> Note that, as stated, this rule allows for one to chose to **be skipped**
> when they could have played.

---

At the beginning of one's turn, if the last play revealed the last cards
necessary to complete an uninterrupted sequence of 4 cards of same rank in the
**trou du cul card order**, the current player can only choose to **fold**.
> Note that this rule transitively implies that the player who last played wins
> the round, as all following players will only be given the option to
> **fold**.
